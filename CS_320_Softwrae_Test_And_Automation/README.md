To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, writing the code should be done with the principles of testing and security in mind.
This means that coding should start from planning. Planning means eliciting requirements, interpreting user needs, and incorporating them into a program and features by the Black Box principle.
Next, we will define and document the test cases, define the definition of done and the test coverage while considering the security risks, take preventative measures such as error handlers and input validators, define roles and permissions, and implement authentication mechanisms.
Lastly, we will run regression testing and test our JUnit tests to validate the desired program flow and the cooperation or non-cooperation of the end user while he uses the software.
Finally, we will take care of the integration of automated testing tools, such as Jenkins and GitHub Actions, to set up API integration and set the CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing to reduce human burnout, reduce development costs, and increase efficiency.
