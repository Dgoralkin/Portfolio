Artemis Financial is a financial institution that offers its service to multiple clients over the web, inside and outside the country's boundaries.
Therefore, it must outstand the highest security standards to safeguard its reputation and the customer data it stores and manipulates. 
One of the internal considerations that we should overlook is client trust and reputation risks.
A mishandled data leak or a breach of sensitive financial information can harm future business prospects and potentially lead to legal prosecution from clients, ultimately damaging the company's public image. 
Applying industry-standard best practices for secure coding to the company’s overall well-being will contribute significantly by making security a shared responsibility for all team members -
and the potential millions of users, starting with design and continuing through coding, testing, and deployment.
As a software developer, my responsibility in addressing security concerns is crucial, as the products I help create could impact human lives, manage their finances, or even be used by governmental offices; 
Therefore, security is a top priority. For this reason, security should be a top priority from the early stages of the development cycle rather than just left to a security team or addressed later, as this can lead to vulnerabilities, deployment delays, and costly fixes.
One of the challenges I found in the project is to assess OWASP dependency check report, identify false positive vulnerabilities, and mitigate all the possible risks by tailoring the right libraries to fire up the code in a safe environment.
Therefore, the key to applying industry standard best practices is to build security into the development process, layer by layer, ensuring that each component—whether code, APIs, or infrastructure—is secured without rushing or cutting corners to meet deadlines.
After refactoring the code, another loop of the vulnerability assessment process was performed, including repeating the secure software development lifecycle and running the dependency check one more time.
While working on the project, I applied industry-standard best practices, such as enforcing security throughout the (SDLC) secure software development lifecycle by addressing security issues in the early stages of the development and integrating data protection and encryption of sensitive data.
Cipher encryption with 256-bit encryption was used for data at rest and in transit. To ensure proper error handling and handle invalid input errors, catching techniques and input sanitization are in place.
In addition, tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check were used to keep software dependencies and libraries updated.
This will ensure easy updates and future modification of the code, whether future vulnerabilities will emerge. These help developers avoid common security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, buffer overflows, and data exposure.
