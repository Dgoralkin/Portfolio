The Pseudocode documents in this reposition describe and outline three different data structures: the basic Vector, Linked lists, Hash table, and Binary Tree. 
Every pseudocode document provides a solution to the problem of reading data from a CSV file, validating it, and storing it in the memory. 
Likewise, the ProjectTwo.cpp file contains a fully functional implementation of the Binary Tree algorithm for storing or pulling information from memory. 
The analysis in this assignment outlines the speed and efficiency of each data structure algorithm, meaning that there is no one tool to solve all problems. 
Rather than every data structure can provide its pros and cons and should be picked correctly during the design phase. 
The work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs while having efficiency, speed, and productivity in mind. 
This means that investing more time in writing the pseudocode and choosing the right data structure for the particular problem can make my app way more efficient and resource-friendly. 
Another focus in this assignment is keeping the app easily maintainable, readable, and adaptable, where each block of code is easily replaceable and can be reused in other developments or even in the same project.
